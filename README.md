## Features

### Property Declarations and Usages Hover

### Rename Property with Global Changes

Modifying property names can be a tedious and error-prone task, especially when you need to update multiple occurrences. Quick-Properties simplifies this process by providing a rename functionality that automatically applies changes to all property declarations and usages throughout the workspace. This ensures consistency and accuracy in your project.
