## Features

### Property Declarations and Usages Hover

### Jump to Declaration or Usage

Quick-Properties allows you to seamlessly navigate between property declarations and usages. Within the hover popup, you can find links that let you jump directly to the declaration or usage of a property. This feature saves you time and effort when exploring and understanding your property files.

### Rename Property with Global Changes

Modifying property names can be a tedious and error-prone task, especially when you need to update multiple occurrences. Quick-Properties simplifies this process by providing a rename functionality that automatically applies changes to all property declarations and usages throughout the workspace. This ensures consistency and accuracy in your project.
